# Tutorial

Open LIFE on TI 84. You should be greeted with:<br>
`BOX SIZE
`<br>
`V?`
<br>
This is where you insert the box size for the program. I recommend around 20 to start off.  Anything more than that will be quite slow due to the TI 84s slow processing speed.

Press F1 to use the pen. Use the direction keys to navigate inside the box. When you want to turn on a cell, press the enter key.
If you hover over a cell that is turned on, it will turn off automatically, so be careful.
When you are done with the pen, press F5 to quit using it. 

To start the cellular automata, press F2. Loading each frame might take longer depending on the box size. 

When you are done using the program, press the ON button to break the program loop.
